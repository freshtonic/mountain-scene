- multiple mountain ranges
  - generate the background mountain range first (high)
  - generate the each successive foreground mountain as a function of the first
    - sharing the random seed to reproduce the similar segment tree might be a good start
    - maybe the foreground mountains have their generation parameters tweaked, instead of
      modifying the parent's height map?
  - texture
  - lighting

- ground & sky
  - moving clouds
- trees?
- altitude render the mountains (no idea how at this stage)
  - meadow / trees
  - bare rock
  - snow above certain altitude where slow < some angle
- sun
  - draggable
  - lens flare (that changes in intensity the more the sun is obscured by a mountain, or cloud)
